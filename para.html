<h2 class="colors">Engineering disciplines</h2>
<p>
One of the great attractions of <span>engineering</span> work is the huge variety of tasks and environments in which engineers find themselves working.From designing programs at a computer terminal, to overseeing maintenance operations for major structures like aircraft, ships, heavy earth moving equipment, mobile cranes and offshore oil platforms â€“ there are many ways to be an engineer.
</p>
<p>
A great deal of engineering work is carried out with the aid of computers. This can range from design, testing, the control of systems, the direction of equipment and the analysis of the properties of materials.A Civil Engineer will work from an architect's drawings and consider whether the chosen materials for a particular building will be strong enough to hold a structure of that height or design. At the same time they would also think about how the structure might affect its surroundings. It is the responsibility of the civil engineer to produce safe, economical and environmentally-sound structures

<h3 class="colors">The main disciplines</h3>
<p>
Historically, mainstream engineering was divided into the four broad disciplines of chemical, civil, electrical and mechanical engineering, with several branches within each discipline covering an enormous range of fields.
