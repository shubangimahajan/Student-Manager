PAGE is a drop and drag tool which helps to create Tkinter GUI interfaces for use within Python programs.  It is a fork of the program Visual Tcl which now produces Python code. PAGE builds a single GUI window and generates a working skeletal Python program using tk and ttk widgets. As other windows are required, they are designed with PAGE and can be easily incorporated into the application. 

It is aimed at a user who wants to rapidly construct a GUI and is willing to compromise generality for ease and speed of construction. It is a helper tool. It does not build an entire application but rather is aimed at building a single GUI window.  It is not a Python Interactive Design Environment(IDE). Stated in other words, PAGE generates a Python class which implements a single GUI window and also supplies all of the boiler-plate code for execution or instantiating the GUI object. If, like me, you have difficulty remembering all the little tricks of getting a GUI to actually appear on the screen, PAGE can show you code that will work.

PAGE is written in Tcl/Tk and so will run on any system with Tcl and Tk installed including Linux, Unix, and OSX. To run PAGE on Windows and Rasperian, it may be necessary to install tcl and tk; both installations are straight forward.

The generated output is pure Python and will run on any system supporting Python with Tkinter and is compatible with both Python 2.7 and Python 3. Executing the generated Python does not require Tcl/Tk.

The 4.18 release enhances the Scrolled widgets to support mousewheel scrolling, changes the style of tkinter imports, adds line numbering to the Python consoles,
 and fixes bugs.

The 4.17 release displays the locked state of a widget in the Attribute Editor, adds a preference for setting the indentation, expands tabs when updating the support module, fixes a subtle bug with placement within labelframe widgets, and enhances the use of geometric attributes in the Attribute Editor.

The 4.16 release fixes an important bug in the support module update feature as well as improving the "Fill Container" function.


The 4.15 release improves the use of the Binding Window, improves the display of callback functions, and the automatic saving of the project file. The ttk::separator widget is added and support of custom widgets expanded. Individual widget geometry can now be locked.

The 4.14 release provides function to save the Widget Tree to a file and function to display callback functions. Fixes are also made for copy and paste as well as to relative placement.


Version 4.13 adds a search function to the Python Consols, fixes a syntax coloring problem, adds additional support for utf-8 encoding, and fixes some bugs.
