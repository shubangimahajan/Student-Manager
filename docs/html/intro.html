<h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>PAGE is a tool which helps to create Python GUI interfaces using
Tkinter and the Tk/ttk widget set.  It is a fork or extension of the
program Visual Tcl (vTcl) which now produces Python code. PAGE runs on
any system with Tcl installed and the generated Python code requires
only Python to execute.</p>
<p>Faced with the problem of building a single GUI window for an
application, PAGE will facilitate designing that GUI window and
building a working skeletal Python program utilizing the Tk/ttk widget
set. As other windows are required, they are designed with PAGE and
incorporated into the application by importing the generated python
modules. See <a class="reference internal" href="use.html#applications-with-multiple-top-level-windows"><span>Applications with Multiple Top-Level Windows</span></a>. Also, PAGE supports design rework to a limited extent.</p>
<p>PAGE is aimed at a user who wants to rapidly construct a GUI and is
willing to compromise generality for ease and speed of construction.
It is a helper tool. It does not build an entire application but
rather is aimed at building a single GUI window.  It is not a Python
Interactive Design Environment (IDE). Stated in other words, PAGE
generates a Python class which implements a single GUI window and also
supplies all of the boiler-plate code for execution or instantiation
of the GUI object. If, like me, you have difficulty remembering all
the little tricks of getting a GUI to show up on the screen, PAGE can
show you code that will work.</p>
<p>When I first set about building programs that exploited Tkinter, I
could not find nearly enough examples. Another way of looking at PAGE
is to consider it to be a Tkinter example builder which can build the
examples you need to see.  It is a good place to start when starting
with Tkinter.</p>
<p>The author is Donald Rozenberg and project page for PAGE is
<a class="reference external" href="http://page.sourceforge.net/">http://page.sourceforge.net/</a>. My email address is Don dot Rozenberg at
gmail dot com.</p>
<p>Note that some of the screen shots in this documentation may appear
with a gray or a wheat background. The reason is that the Tk default
color is gray but I prefer wheat.</p>

<h2>Change History<a class="headerlink" href="#change-history" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>the 4.19 release:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>provides Stash and Apply mechanism for transferring attributes from
one widget to others,</li>
<li>enables context menus in the Attribute Editor for transferring
attributes from one widget to others -
<a class="reference internal" href="interface.html#propagate"><span>see the Attribute Editor</span></a>,</li>
<li>further enhances scrolling of PAGE windows,</li>
<li>fixes bugs related to color preferences,</li>
</ul>
<p>The 4.18 release:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>enhances the Scrolled widgets to support mousewheel scrolling over
data windows in generated Python modules,</li>
<li>enhances mousewheel scrolling over PAGE data windows,</li>
<li>removed some warning messages and added other more meaningful ones,</li>
<li>improves the style of the tkinter import statements (see <a class="reference internal" href="use.html#naming"><span>Naming Conventions</span></a>),</li>
<li>adds line numbering to the Python consoles,</li>
<li>adds Top button to several PAGE windows,  ...</li>
</ul>
<p>The 4.17 release: displays the locked state of a widget in the
Attribute Editor, adds a preference for setting the indentation,
expands tabs when updating the support module, fixes a subtle bug with
placement within labelframe widgets, and enhances the use of geometric
attributes in the Attribute Editor.</p>
<p>The 4.16 release fixes an important bug in the support module update
feature as well as improving the &#8220;Fill Container&#8221; function.</p>
<p>The 4.15 release improves the use of the Binding Window, improves the
display of callback functions, and the automatic saving of the project
file. The ttk::separator widget is added and support of custom
widgets expanded. Individual widget geometries can now be locked to
prevent mouse changes.</p>
<p>The 4.14 release provides function to save the Widget Tree to a
file and function to display callback functions. Fixes are also made
for copy and paste as well as to relative placement.</p>
<p>The 4.13 release adds a search function to the Python Consols, fixes a
syntax coloring problem, adds additional support for utf-8 encoding, and
fixes some bugs.</p>
<p>The 4.12 release fixes several bugs related to placement, cut and
paste, and borrowing.</p>
<p>The 4.11 release allows one to copy a menu bar from an existing
project to the current project. An important addition is the inclusion
of a tutorial written by Greg Walters.</p>
<p>The 4.10 release includes a reuse facility which allows one to copy from
existing projects and paste to the current project.  This release also
modifies the startup to automatically create the Toplevel widget and
expands support for the Canvas widget and adds some checking of
identifier syntax. In addition, there is a new custom version of the
TNotebook widget which incorporates an icon for closing tabs.</p>
<p>The 4.9 release fixes bugs related to state values of several
widgets. It also improves the Widget Tree by changing the labels to
display the class and the alias of the widget and automatically
updating it in more cases.</p>
<p>The 4.8.x releases fixes bugs and updates the documentation.</p>
<p>The 4.8 release includes support for Custom widgets which are widgets
for which the Python implementation is left to the user. Python 3
versions of the examples are included. The widgets handles have been
enlarged and colored to facilitate selection. Bugs related to the
changing of aliases have been corrected. Finally, a function which
expands a widget to fill its container has been added to some widgets
I have fixed some bug within the font handling code and that may
require that fonts in existing PAGE projects be re-specified.</p>
<p>The 4.7 release includes support for binding events to top level
windows and reorganizes the generated code for greater clarity and
provides variable parameter lists for the init function in the support
module using the Python convention of *vargs, **kwargs. Important
fixes for Cut, Copy, and Paste and for the TCombobox widget.</p>
<p>The 4.6 release includes new function. a) Shows generated code in
separate console windows. b) Allows loading of consol windows without
generating code. c) Allows the opening of user&#8217;s favorite IDE with
saved versions of the generated code. d) Corresponding changes in
the Gen_Python menu.</p>
<p>The 4.5 release incorporates new flexibility for the location of the
toplevel widget in the generated GUI using the default location
determined by the window manager.</p>
<p>The 4.4.x releases contain bug fixes.</p>
<p>The 4.4 releases supported popup or context menus. Also, support for
ttk menubuttons was removed pending more debugging and the Labelframe
widget was added. Finally, support for function definition was;
however, PAGE still defined skeleton functions as before.
The 4.3 release includes code to update an existing support module
with Tkinter variables and skeleton functions newly required as a result of
<a class="reference internal" href="rework.html#rework"><span>Rework</span></a>.</p>
<p>The 4.2 releases has new function which aids <a class="reference internal" href="rework.html#rework"><span>Rework</span></a>.  This is a
fairly extensive departure from the previous workings of
PAGE. Additional examples were added to illustrate some aspects of the
rework scheme. They also provided additional Help and additional
scrolled widgets.</p>
<p>The 4.1 releases contains several changes dealing with preferences
dealing with font preferences and function to backup versions of the
generated GUI.</p>
<p>The 4.0 release contains sufficient advances including:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Significant improvements in the specification and clarity of Preferences.</li>
<li>Significant work with color and associated connections with styles.  Emphasis on readability of generated style code. Unfortunately, this seems to work better with Linux/Unix systems than with Windows or OS X.</li>
<li>Better support for OS X.</li>
<li>Better support for the Scale and TScale widgets.</li>
<li>Better support for Toplevel widgets. You can now change attributes; background and cursor, for example.</li>
<li>Corrected problems with the TMenubutton.</li>
<li>Shifted emphasis to Python 2.7 from 2.6.</li>
<li>Added the ttk::sizegrip widget.</li>
<li>Fixed numerous bugs.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The 3.0 release was a major revision of PAGE initiated because of the
following events:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>The release of Tcl/Tk 8.5 which includes the ttk widget
set. This is a themed widget set containing new core widgets
such as notebook, combobox, treeview and progressbar widgets.
Further, the themed feature allows the same design look natural
on Linux, Windows, and OS X.</li>
<li>The advent of a new version of Visual Tcl upon which PAGE is
built. The new version provides an improved user interface.</li>
<li>I have realized that some of the bells and whistles that I
included before are superfluous or perhaps error prone.</li>
<li>Although relative placement was incorporated in the previous
version, it added to the desirability of making a major
revision because some Tix widgets had some problems when
stretched. I want to thank George Tellalov for his suggestions
and encouragement regarding this feature.</li>
<li>The Pyttk package by Guilherme Polo showed me how to create
scrolled versions of text boxes and list boxes in a very
transparent manner.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>

<h2>X Concepts<a class="headerlink" href="#x-concepts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Let me review some X window definitions and concepts in order to
avoid confusion with the terms used here, including top-level
window. Some of this information is taken from &#8220;Tcl and the Tk
Toolkit&#8221; by John K. Ousterhout. &#8220;The X Window System provides
facilities for manipulating windows on displays. ... Each screen
displays a hierarchical collection of rectangular windows, starting
with a &#8216;root window&#8217; that covers the entire area of the screen. The
root window may have any number of child windows, each of which is
called a &#8216;top-level window&#8217;.  An X application typically manages
several top-level windows, one for each of the application&#8217;s major
panels and dialogs.&#8221; One can also speak of an application&#8217;s &#8216;root&#8217;
top-level window. This is the terminology from Grayson&#8217;s book. John

<div class="section" id="visual-tcl">
<h2>Visual Tcl<a class="headerlink" href="#visual-tcl" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>PAGE is based on Stewart Allen&#8217;s Visual Tcl program. In fact, it is
vTcl, with modifications and several additional modules that generates
Python code. And yes, it is written in Tcl! Why not? Tcl is a great
language to have available on your machine. It has features which I
would like to see in Python. There are many great programs written in
that language.  Further, it leaves the door open to use the same
techniques for GUI builders in other languages which support Tk. The
disadvantage of using a Tcl implementation is that one is restricted
to widget sets which are available to both Tcl and Python. Ann
additional disadvantage is that Windows users probably need to install
Tcl/Tk. In previous versions of PAGE, I supported Tix widgets to
provide a comprehensive widget set. With the arrival of ttk widgets in
Tcl/Tk 8.5, I felt that the ttk widget set was sufficient and dropped
Tix.</p>
<p>PAGE is a modified version of Visual Tcl. Visual Tcl is a interactive
Tcl/Tk program for generating whole projects in Tcl/Tk. Building PAGE, I
added the feature of also generating a Python program which realizes
the same GUI.  My changes were primarily to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Add the modules which generate Python code.</li>
<li>Add support to Visual Tcl for the ttk widget set as well as scrolled
versions of several widgets like listbox, textbox, and treeview.</li>
<li>Aim the program to handle only one top level window.  I ditched the
whole window project orientation. Facilities for testing Tcl
programs, for defining functions, support for multiple toplevel
windows, and support for geometry managers other than the placer
geometry manager were among those deleted.</li>
<li>Simplify the interface to only support the needs of one
building Python interfaces.</li>
<li>Write some documentation and comments for the program.
Documentation of Virtual Tcl is virtually nonexistent and that is
truly sad but all too common with open source programming.</li>
<li>Fix bugs.</li>
</ul>
<p>My changes have become so numerous that it is perhaps wrong to call it
merely a modification of Virtual Tcl.  I now think of PAGE as a fork
which will probably be of little interest to the maintainers of Vtcl
nor should they be saddled with any responsibility for the state of my
version.  Since I have diverged so much from Visual Tcl, I decided to
replace the Visual Tcl splash screen.</p>
<p>I was looking at different GUI generators for Tcl/Tk with a view of
converting the output of one to Python when I came across Visual Tcl
and the work of Constantin Teodorescu in generating Java from Visual
Tcl. I thought if one could automatically generate Java, it should be
even easier and much better to generate Python.</p>
<p>I believe that Stewart Allen wrote Visual Tcl in the 1996-1998 time
period to aid in the development of Tcl/Tk applications. Constantin
Teodorescu modified vTcl to generate Java code using SWING as the
widget set. Looking at the Java generator convinced me to try doing
PAGE.  I was able to discern its behavior in spite of the nearly total
lack of documentation, usually finding an existing procedure when
needed.</p>
<p>PAGE supports only the placer geometry manager. In the past, I
worked with Visual Basic and the placer geometry manager seemed
comfortable and got me useful results. Similarly,
Constantin Teodorescu also limited the Java generation to the placer
geometry manager. It seems really natural with the drag and drop
paradigm. One disadvantage is that some of the sizes could be wrong if
fonts change. This is because several Tk widgets have sizing based on
font parameters. This has implications if the GUI is generated with
different fonts or resolution than are active during execution. There
may also be similar problems if the generated GUI is moved to other
platforms or environments.  It is interesting that many people writing
about Tk and Tkinter dismiss the placer geometry manager.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="design-paradigm-using-page">
<h2>Design Paradigm using PAGE<a class="headerlink" href="#design-paradigm-using-page" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The PAGE view of the application development process is to build the
program one GUI window at a time using PAGE to automate the
construction of the GUI window realized in the GUI module and to put
all of the supporting application dependent code in a support module.
I expect to change the GUI often as I polish its appearance and add
widgets, but ideally would only automatically generate the support
module once. The difficult coding job should be restricted to getting
the application right and not to realizing the conventions of Tkinter.
In other words, reworking the GUI appearance should have only a
minimum impact on the application code.</p>
<p>PAGE generates a single Toplevel window for use in an application.
In doing that, PAGE generates two Python modules, the GUI module and the
support module while preserving the design in the project file.</p>
<p>The orthodox view of object oriented programming groups all of the
attributes and methods of an object into a single class. I normally
follow that dictum.  PAGE deviates from that rule in that it places
the automatically generated code in a GUI module and relegates the
hand-coded event functions to a separate support module. All
that PAGE does with the support module is optionally create a skeletal
version of that module containing linkages between the two modules and
skeleton callback functions. PAGE also can update the support module
to the extend of adding skeletons for new callback functions required
by rework.</p>
<p>The separation of the two module results from requiring a fool proof
method for reworking the GUI.  I have found that I am constantly
changing the GUI for reasons such as improving its appearance,
clarifying its behavior, adding new widgets to support new function,
etc.; I call this rework.  Once I have researched and written code for
the support module, I don&#8217;t want to expose that code to some &#8220;smart&#8221;
automation program, even my own, but I still want to use PAGE to
update the GUI. Implementing rework requires that PAGE be able to
distinguish between automatically generated code, which can be
rewritten, and hand written code which must be left alone.  The only
safe way I could think to do that was to separate the code into two
modules. <strong>A paramount requirement of PAGE is the preservation of
manual code</strong> as the user goes around the loop of polishing the GUI
design and expanding and testing the application.</p>
<p>When building a multiple top-level window application, I recommend
that one use PAGE to build the &#8216;root&#8217; top-level window and then use
the corresponding generated Python module as the main module of
the application. When one needs additional top-level windows, use PAGE
to specify them and use that code as additional modules for the
application which can be imported as needed. (Generated GUI modules
will contain automatically generated functions to aid in creating and
destroying them within the modules.)</p>
<p>The GUI module contains code to actually cause the GUI to appear on
the screen. By interacting with the GUI, the user causes events, such
as selecting a button or adding text to an entry, to occur which
really invoke callback functions which are implemented as functions
found in the support module.</p>
<p>A design goal of PAGE is to allow the user to actually execute and see
the GUI before the application is completed. To that end, generation
of the support module will provide skeletal functions for the callback
functions.</p>
<p>When one does a save in PAGE, it saves the design as a tcl
file which then can be used as an argument to PAGE allowing one to
modify or augment the GUI. Even more important, if PAGE screws up it
can be used to restart the process at the point where the GUI was
saved. So, save often.  The Tcl GUI design file is not an executable
stand-alone script.  It contains Tcl/Tk code and is used as the
argument of the tcl source command.</p>
<p>The following diagram shows the design/implementation loop supported
by PAGE.</p>
<img alt="_images/paradigm.png" class="align-center" src="_images/paradigm.png" />
<p>PAGE generates the three files shown above. The two modules on the left
are required to realize the GUI window as a Python program. The GUI
module as conceived by the author is completely generated by PAGE while
the support module will contain all of the hand coded Python required by
the application using the GUI window. The &lt;name&gt; may be thought of as
a project name and must be a legal Python identifier because the
generated Python code will use &lt;name&gt; in an import statement.</p>
<p>The project file records the GUI window description in the form of a
Tcl/Tk module. It serves as input to PAGE for subsequent rework
iterations. It is not an executable program.</p>
<p>Every time you make a set of modifications to the GUI design, you will
want to generate and test a new GUI module. However, the support
module needs to be changed only when GUI modifications refer to new
callback functions. There are a couple of additional but infrequent
cases as well. (They include the addition of Tkinter variables used by
widgets such as Label and a definition of a custom widget.)</p>
<p>The dashed line is meant to convey the idea that you will not want to
change the support module each time the GUI design is modified. For
that reason PAGE has separate commands for generating the GUI module
and the support module.  Also, the generation of the GUI module has
two variations, complete generation and updating the support module.</p>
<p>The first time that a GUI is designed, one wants to generate both
Python modules. The support module will have all the necessary boiler
plate necessary to work with the GUI module; i.e., the GUI module and
the support module should be an executable program even with no manual
code added to the skeletal callback functions.</p>
<p>With subsequent modifications of the GUI, the support module may need
to be updated by PAGE only to add skeletal functions for newly
referenced callbacks, etc. in the GUI.  <em>No code is deleted.</em> Further,
backup versions of all generated files are saved.</p>
<p>Please see <a class="reference internal" href="rework.html#rework"><span>Rework</span></a> for more discussion of this world view.</p>

<div class="section" id="a-very-short-description-of-using-page">
<h2>A Very Short Description of using PAGE<a class="headerlink" href="#a-very-short-description-of-using-page" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<img alt="_images/overview.png" class="align-center" src="_images/overview.png" />
<p>There are three generated files associated with a PAGE GUI.  They are
a GUI design module, a Python GUI module which contains generated
Python code for instantiating a class which displays the defined GUI,
and a Python support module which is a skeleton for the code written
outside of PAGE which realizes the function of the GUI. The GUI module
and the support module can be executed from within PAGE to demonstrate
the GUI.</p>
<p>Using a drag-and-drop paradigm inspired by that of Visual Basic, one
constructs or designs the GUI window from Tk widgets within a top
level window and modifies the attributes appropriately, when satisfied
the user then issues commands to create the GUI module and the support
module. Those modules are displayed and may be saved and executed to
verify the appearance of the GUI. The remaining step of writing the
necessary code in the support module to realize the function or
application behavior of the GUI is left to the user.  The rest of this
document will expand and exemplify the first two steps of this
process.</p>
<p>PAGE generates two Python modules from a GUI specification.  The first
module, called the GUI module, is the code to create the GUI and is
named &lt;name&gt;.py. All the code in this module is generated by PAGE. The
other module, termed the support module, named &lt;name&gt;_support.py
contains the code that is necessary to complete the function of the
GUI.  As generated it contains skeleton code for the callback
functions named in the course of laying out the GUI, the definitions
of required Tkinter Variable classes referred to in the GUI, a default
definition of a custom widget, and finally the necessary linkage
between the two modules. The GUI design specification is captured and
saved for later use in reworking or modifying the design in the file
named &lt;name&gt;.tcl.</p>
<p>A user begins by invoking PAGE using a script, &#8216;page&#8217; in Linux.
Starting with version 4.10, a new toplevel widget is automatically
generated.  This toplevel widget is the GUI window. (In this manual, I
use the terms Button-1 and Button-3 rather than left button and right
button because a user may be using a left handed mouse. This is
consistent with Tcl documentation. Button-1 is under the index
finger.)</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Using Button-1 on the mouse, drag the toplevel window to where you
want it and resize it appropriately. Change attributes such as
title as desired using the attribute editor. If the &#8220;default
origin&#8221; is YES then the generated window will be placed at the
default location as determined by the system window manager,
otherwise it will use the coordinates of the current toplevel
location.</li>
</ol>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li>Select a desired widget from the Widget Toolbar with Button-1 and
place it within its parent by clicking Button-1 within the
parent. One can then use the mouse to move and resize the widget
(For some of the complex widgets, one has to press the control key
along with Button-1 to select the entire widget.) Using the
Attribute Editor, then change any of the attributes of the widget
including the names of callback functions. It is probably a good
idea to provide an alias which will make the generated code easier
to read.</li>
</ol>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="3">
<li>Repeat the above step (2) until the GUI is complete.</li>
</ol>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li>The remaining step is to generate the Python code in new python
modules with the same root name based on the root name the &#8220;tcl&#8221;
file. This is done by selecting commands &#8216;Gen_Python&#8217; in the
submenu in the menu bar of the main window and generating the
Python code. Two Python modules are required the Python module for
the Python GUI and the Python support module containing callback
functions, etc.. First generate the GUI module, you will see a new
window, the Python console, where the code can be expected to
appear. After saving the GUI module, generate the support module.
Another Python console will appear containing the support
module. Again save the module. Execute the code, to preview the
GUI. It only shows the GUI, it is not the complete application; you
have to write that.</li>
</ol>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="5">
<li>Create the necessary Python functions to realize the function of
the application.  PAGE will facilitate this by generating skeleton
functions for any functions named as callback functions in command
attributes and other boiler plate code in a second python module
with the same rootname with &#8220;_support&#8221; appended.  As of version
4.6, PAGE can directly open an IDE such as idleX with two windows
containing the stored version of the GUI and support module
respectively. I want to avoid building an IDE.</li>
</ol>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="6">
<li>Test the GUI, this can be done by selecting the &#8220;Run&#8221; button in
either of the PAGE consoles.
This will show the resulting GUI.</li>
</ol>
<p>With some Tk widgets, variables can be used to track changes to an
entered value. The Checkbutton and Radiobutton widgets require
variables to work properly. Variables can also be used to validate the
contents of an entry widget, and to change the text in label
widgets. When using those widgets in Python-Tkinker programs it is
necessary to use &#8220;Tk Variable Classes&#8221; - BooleanVar, DoubleVar,
IntVar, and StringVar - which create variable wrappers that can be
used wherever Tk can use a traced Tcl variable. In this document I
refer to these classes as &#8220;Tkinter variables&#8221;. PAGE assists by
creating the definitions for the Tkinter variables as well as
instantiating the classes. See the <a class="reference external" href="http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/variable.htm">effbot website</a> for additional
information.  PAGE attempts to help by supplying boiler plate to
define and instantiate the required classes.</p>
<p>When the GUI code is saved or the File-&gt;Save is invoked, a Tcl design
file is saved so that one can come back and modify the GUI.  See
<a class="reference internal" href="rework.html#rework"><span>Rework</span></a> for details.</p>
<p>Release 4.10 added the capability to paste widgets from existing
projects into the current toplevel GUI window. This is a new
additional way of selecting and including widgets into the GUI. See
<a class="reference internal" href="rework.html#reuse"><span>Reuse</span></a> for details.</p>

<h2>Status of PAGE<a class="headerlink" href="#status-of-page" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>PAGE runs on many operating systems including Linux, Windows, OS X,
and most versions of Unix. Recently, it has been running on Raspbian,
the Linux derivative for the Raspberry Pi 3.</p>
<p>PAGE supports many of the Tk widgets and many of the ttk widgets, other
widgets seem to be of lower priority to me; creating scrollbars and
linking them with text boxes and the like seemed  confusing so I
skipped them in favor of auto-scrolled widgets like scrolled list box,
scrolled text box, and scrolled tree. Though not directly implemented in
the ttk widget set, Guilherme Polo in his Pyttk samples shows how to
easily implement them; they seem great, therefore, they are included.</p>
<p>The supported widgets:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Tk Widgets</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Toplevel</li>
<li>Button</li>
<li>Canvas</li>
<li>Checkbox</li>
<li>Entry</li>
<li>Frame</li>
<li>Labelframe</li>
<li>Listbox</li>
<li>Message</li>
<li>Popupmenu</li>
<li>Radiobutton</li>
<li>Scale</li>
<li>Spinbox</li>
<li>Text</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Themed Widgets</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>TButton</li>
<li>TCombobox</li>
<li>TEntry</li>
<li>TFrame</li>
<li>TLabel</li>
<li>TLabelframe</li>
<li>TMenubutton</li>
<li>TNotebook</li>
<li>TPanedwindow</li>
<li>TProgressbar</li>
<li>TRadiobutton</li>
<li>TScale</li>
<li>TSeparator</li>
<li>TSizegrip</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Enhanced widgets.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Scrolledentry</li>
<li>Scrolledlistbox</li>
<li>Scrolledtext</li>
<li>Scrolledtreeview</li>
<li>Custom</li>
<li>PNotebook</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I have included Canvas in the above lists; however, I have rarely used
the canvas widget directly and do not fully understand its use or
programming. I am concerned that its programming is so general that I
cannot usefully help with PAGE.  It is there and Page will manipulate a
canvas widget into your GUI.</p>
<p>With version 4.8, I have include the Custom widget, which allows the
user to include his own special widget, provided that he has a
Python/Tkinter implementation. See <a class="reference internal" href="examples.html#custom-example"><span>Custom Widgets</span></a>. I added this
feature because I want to use PAGE to build a photo album application
where I need a scrolling window for displaying photo thumbnail
images. I was able to find several such tkinter classes but none that
I felt comfortable including as PAGE widgets for any of several
reasons such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>I don&#8217;t fully understand the code.</li>
<li>There is not a corresponding tk implementation which would allow
me to incorporate it into Virtual Tcl functions like the
Attribute Editor.</li>
<li>The one I actually use successfully is alleged to contain bugs.</li>
<li>The generality of the widgets may be limited.</li>
<li>Documentation may be wanting.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>So for users who have a tkinter widget that they want to use, I have
implemented the Custom widget which can be placed, sized, saved in the
generated tcl file, etc., while the tkinter implementation is added by
the user to the support module.  Again, configuration properties are
not available to within PAGE but may be user-manipulated in the
support module. With version 4.15 you may have more than one custom
widget type per GUI window and you can have several instances of them.</p>
<p>One of the important features of the ttk widgets is the ability to
generate and modify themes.  Unfortunately, PAGE provides only
rudimentary facilities for manipulating themes. See a later section on
Styles and Themes.
<a class="reference internal" href="themes.html#styles"><span>Styles and Themes</span></a></p>
<p>As conceived Visual Tcl will save executable Tcl files which evolve
into the application. PAGE is trying to generate Python applications
so the resulting Tcl/Tk design files need not be executable but they
definitely are saved and can be loaded into PAGE for rework and
backtracking to a previous state. They are the project files referred
to below.</p>
<p>Knowing that I should have tested more, written more, and included
more widgets and more examples, I apologize.  If you come across bugs
or have comments please let me know and I will fix them if I can. I
can be reached at [don {dot} rozenberg {at} gmail {dot} com].  Please
report problems and suggestions to me, it is the best way to help PAGE
to be as good as it can be.  I have mainly developed PAGE on LINUX but
I have done some testing of PAGE on Windows XP and on a Mac. It even
works on the Raspberry PI.</p>
<p>While it seems prudent to advise users to keep it simple, take a look
at examples/complex.py where I have paned windows nested inside pane
windows and a notebook nested inside a nested paned window.</p>
<p>For release 4.0, I spent about two months working with the &#8220;Theme&#8221;
part of ttk and have had only partial success.  I now believe that the
&#8220;Theme&#8221; part of ttk is really a very poor piece of software at all
levels - concept, implementation, and especially documentation. My
guess is if it had been well documented it would have been recognized
by even the author as junk. I find it hard to believe that the people
who control Tcl/Tk allowed it in the code base. I continue to support
ttk because of the paned window, notebook, and treeview widgets.</p>
<p>With release 4.2, I have addressed the problem of rework, hopefully,
allowing easy tweaking of the GUI without jeopardizing th users hand
code.  See <a class="reference internal" href="rework.html#rework"><span>Rework</span></a>.</p>
<p>I am not happy with the menubutton support, I will revisit it in a
future release. So far I have not found it to be a useful widget in
any of the GUI&#8217;s that I have created; I would appreciate comments about
that.</p>
<p>PAGE allows one to build an application one GUI window at a time, with
release 4.10, I have added Borrow functionality which allows one to
copy widget specification from existing projects and paste them in the
GUI currently under development. See <a class="reference internal" href="rework.html#borrow"><span>Borrowing Widgets from Existing Projects</span></a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="installation">
<h2>Installation<a class="headerlink" href="#installation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The required packages for executing PAGE are:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>PAGE 4.15 or greater - This is the GUI generator. Actually one
should be using the latest version.</li>
<li>Tcl/Tk 8.6 or greater. - I am using the Tcl/Tk 8.6.7 ActiveTcl
package. Tcl/Tk is required for executing PAGE. Tcl/Tk is
required because PAGE is written in Tcl/Tk.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Even though Python executes the tkinter interface to Tcl/Tk, a full
installation of Tcl/Tk is required to run PAGE.</strong> Many Windows users reported
problems, manifested in the message &#8220;unable to find wish.exe&#8221;, with PAGE
were resolved with the installation of Tcl/Tk.</p>
<p>The package required for executing the python code generated by PAGE
is:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>Python 2.7 or greater. The current version of the Python</dt>
<dd><p class="first last">tkinter package includes the ttk widget set.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>One does not have to install Tcl/Tk or PAGE to execute programs
containing GUI&#8217;s generated by PAGE. All that is necessary is a Python
version which includes the ttk widgets.</p>
<p>Since Python 2.6 had its last release scheduled for October 2013, I am
now only supporting Python 2.7 which includes Pyttk.  I am also
recommending the most up-to-date ActiveTcl package.  I would recommend
that anyone using a package you generate with PAGE be instructed to
use Python 2.7 or 3.2 or later.</p>
<p>The installations that I am using place the directory containing PAGE,
named &#8220;page&#8221; into the users home directory.  This directory contains
the script &#8220;page&#8221;, which is executed to invoke PAGE on Unix-like
systems.  The script &#8220;page&#8221; is altered to reflect the locations of
&#8220;wish&#8221; the Tk interpreter, and the location of the PAGE directory.
This alteration can be performed manually or by execution the
&#8220;configure&#8221; script in the PAGE directory. This is not necessary with
Windows.</p>
<p id="configure">The package contains the file &#8220;configure&#8221; which when executed on a
UNIX-like OS such as UNIX, Linux, OS X, etc.  will create &#8220;page&#8221; a
script for executing PAGE.  It is executed in the page directory and
its function is to:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Determine the full path for wish (first trying for wish8.6 and then
wish8.5) and embedding that path as a variable in the page script.</li>
<li>Setting the full path of the page directory as a variable in the
page script.</li>
</ol>
<p>If it completes setting up both one can then copy the page script
anywhere in the file system and execute it.  It looks in just a few
places for wish and so may not find where you have installed it. It
does look in the default location for ActiveTcl-8.6
(/opt/ActiveTcl-8.6/bin). If it fails to find a version of wish that
has been installed on your system, then manually edit the page script.</p>
<p>With the release of PAGE 4.0, it is necessary to remove any &#8221;.pagerc&#8221;
in your home directory which you may have because the new preference
code may not work with a &#8221;.pagerc&#8221; created with an older version.
Also, existing &#8221;.tcl&#8221; file created with an older version of PAGE may
not work.  At this point, the release of version 4.0, I will only
entertain bug reports which can be recreated using Python 2.7, Tcl/Tk
version 8.6, and PAGE 4.0+.</p>

<h3>Installation on Linux<a class="headerlink" href="#installation-on-linux" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>I am now running Mint 18.3 which including Python 2.7.12 and for Tcl/Tk
8.6.6. I am using the ActiveTcl distribution for Tcl/Tk. This is what
I recommend. Current Linux distributions like Ubuntu and Mint include
Python 2.7 and Tcl/Tk 8.5.  So I have installed  ActiveTcl-8.6.1 on my
system.</p>
<p>If you need to install Tcl/Tk 8.6, a good source is the ActiveState
binaries for Tcl, which is what I am using. See the section below
regarding the Raspberry.</p>
<p>The steps for installing PAGE are:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Untar the distribution file in your home directory. You
can probably use &#8216;tar zxvf pageXXX.tgz. This will put all the
distribution in the subdirectory &#8220;page&#8221;.</li>
</ol>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Run &#8221;./configure&#8221; in the installation directory, it generates the
script &#8220;page&#8221; which can invoke PAGE.  You may want to insure that
the script &#8220;page&#8221; is in your execution path. If the script fails,
manually edit the version of the page script from the installation,
see <a class="reference internal" href="#configure"><span>configure command</span></a>.</li>

<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Remove any &#8221;.pagerc&#8221; in your home directory file.</li>

<h3>Installation on Raspbian (Raspberry Pi)<a class="headerlink" href="#installation-on-raspbian-raspberry-pi" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Rasperian does not come with tcl/tk installed but there is no
ActiveTcl for arm processors and so one has to install both tcl and tk
from the repositories using apt-get.  This works for Raspbian
versions based on Jesse or Stretch. However, there are no tcl or tk
packages available for the version of Rasperian on my Raspberry
Pi 2. I successfully built and installed tcl from source but was
unable to build tk because of a dependency on the package libx11-dev
which I have not been able to satisfy. So PAGE runs on the Raspberry Pi 3
but not earlier.  The generated code does run on the Raspberry
Pi 2. See <a class="reference internal" href="examples.html#rplay"><span>Rplay</span></a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="installation-on-windows">
<h3>Installation on Windows<a class="headerlink" href="#installation-on-windows" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Installing PAGE under Windows is considerably easier than with early
versions.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>Obtain and install the most recent version of ActiveTcl</strong>; use an
8.6+ version.</li>
<li>Obtain from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org">http://www.python.org</a> the windows
installer for the most recent version of Python and install it.  If
you install 2.7 or later, or 3.1 or later you will be fine.</li>
<li>Download page-4.x.x.exe and execute it.</li>
</ol>
<p>winpage.bat is the analog to the &#8220;page&#8221; script mentioned
above. winpage.bat is a one line file containing:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">start</span> <span class="o">/</span><span class="nb">min</span>   <span class="n">wish</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">exe</span> <span class="n">c</span><span class="p">:</span>\<span class="n">page</span>\<span class="n">page</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">tcl</span> <span class="o">%</span><span class="mi">1</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>With Version 4.2.2, it is now feasible to install PAGE in any
directory and have the icon start the program.  This has been tested
on Windows 7 running under VirtualBox.  The default directory for
installation is C:\page. If PAGE is installed in a different
directory then winpage.bat will have to be changed  to
reflect the that fact. For instance if it is installed in C:\x\y
then the winpage.bat should look like</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">start</span> <span class="o">/</span><span class="nb">min</span> <span class="n">wish</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">exe</span> <span class="n">C</span><span class="p">:</span>\<span class="n">x</span>\<span class="n">y</span>\<span class="n">page</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">tcl</span> <span class="o">%</span><span class="mi">1</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>It was suggested by Pär Smårs that the generation of winpage.bat with
the correct installation directory should be done magically at
installation.  With version 4.8.7, I managed to do this.  Since I have
a deficient understanding of the Windows world, I decline trying to
update the path environmental variable.</p>

<p>I have not done much with PAGE on OS X.  However, several users,

I should try to support PAGE on that system.  However, the

satisfactory to me so I recommend sticking with default colors.</p>
